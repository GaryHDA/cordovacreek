# The Beaver Relief Cleanup
## An effort to reduce pollution in a naturalized ecosystem
  
The Beaver Relief Cleanup was an event hosted by Soil Born Farms(SBF), facilitated by SBF's Groundskeeper, and executed by thirteen volunteers from the Sacramento Picks It Up group, in response to an accumulation of trash within, and along Cordova Creek's(CC), headwaters on 03/20/2022.

This location continues to collect such items as: rubber balls, snack packaging, tobacco products, plastic, metal and glass drink bottles, office furniture, wheels, shoes and clothing(just to name a few), as they become entangled with willow branches and stranded on dry land.

The view upon arrival, as a previous rain event had distributed trash/debris onto the creek bank.

One reason for the trash concentration here may be that it is where the concrete lined storm drain ends and CC begins, so trash flows from places upstream unimpeded until it hits the naturalized zone, where during heavy rain events, some is caught in the brush or stranded above the waterline.

Within a year after the completion of Phase 2 of the CC Nat project, Nature moved in and began to contribute to the endeaver.

## Return to Cordova Creek

Samples were collected in the first two months of 2022. The same protocol was used at the original survey boundary from the first Cordova Creek project. These samples were both below the median value from 2017.

Trash colleceted by volunteers at BRC

Results from the BRC in March 2022 demonstrated an accumulation of debris upstream of the survey site. Suggesting that the nature area is fulfilling its role.
